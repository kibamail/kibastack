# Kumo MTA policy configurations

To execute and test these policies, Run the kumo mta image `ghcr.io/kumocorp/kumomta-dev:latest` mounting this directory as a volume to the `/opt/kumomta/etc/policy` directory.

You may just use `make kumo` to run the command that runs kumomta and mount this volume.
