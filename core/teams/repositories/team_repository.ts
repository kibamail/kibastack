 * TeamRepository handles database operations for team management.

 *
 * - Creating and managing teams
 * - Handling team memberships and permissions
 * - Managing team resources like sending domains
 * - Implementing the free credit system for new teams
 *
 * The repository uses transactions for operations that modify multiple related records,
 * ensuring data consistency even in case of failures. It also implements caching for
 * frequently accessed team data to improve performance.
